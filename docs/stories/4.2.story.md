# Story 4.2: GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

## Status
**DONE**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** automated CI/CD that generates code, builds containers, and deploys on push,
**so that** changes automatically flow from repository to production without manual intervention.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. GitHub Actions workflow triggered on push to main branch
2. Workflow runs generator (bmad2pf.py) to create fresh code from BMAD sources
3. Docker image built and tagged with commit SHA
4. Image pushed to GitHub Container Registry (ghcr.io)
5. Tests run before deployment (pytest for unit and integration tests)
6. Deployment step updates specified service (Railway/Fly.io/Cloud Run)
7. Rollback capability via previous image tags
8. Build status badge displayed in repository README

### Environment Variables and Secrets
[Source: architecture.md#configuration-management]

**Repository Secrets** (Settings → Secrets):
```yaml
GITHUB_TOKEN         # Auto-provided for packages
RAILWAY_TOKEN        # From Railway dashboard
FLY_API_TOKEN       # From fly tokens create
GCP_CREDENTIALS     # Service account JSON
OPENAI_API_KEY      # For deployed app
```

**Repository Variables** (Settings → Variables):
```yaml
DEPLOY_TARGET       # railway|flyio|cloudrun
DEPLOY_URL         # https://your-app.example.com
```

### Platform-Specific Deployment Notes

#### Railway
- Uses Railway CLI via GitHub Action
- Automatic SSL and domain provisioning
- Environment variables set in Railway dashboard

#### Fly.io
- Requires fly.toml in repository
- Uses flyctl for deployment
- Supports multiple regions

#### Google Cloud Run
- Requires service account with Cloud Run Admin role
- Automatic scaling to zero
- Pay-per-request pricing

### Rollback Strategy (KISS)
1. **Image Tags**: Each deploy tagged with commit SHA
2. **Manual Rollback**: Re-run workflow from previous commit
3. **Emergency**: Direct platform console to switch image

### Build Optimization
- **Docker Layer Caching**: Uses GitHub Actions cache
- **Parallel Jobs**: Test and build can run simultaneously
- **Conditional Deploy**: Only on main branch after tests pass
- **Skip CI**: Add `[skip ci]` to commit message to bypass

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Workflow syntax validation: `actionlint .github/workflows/*.yml`
- Local testing with act: `act push -W .github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- Test in fork before merging to main
- Monitor Actions tab for build status

4. test_docker_image_builds_and_pushes

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation demonstrates strong adherence to KISS principles while providing comprehensive CI/CD functionality. The GitHub Actions workflow is clean, well-structured, and properly implements the three-stage pipeline (test → build-and-push → deploy) with appropriate dependencies. The documentation is thorough and provides clear instructions for rollback scenarios. The integration with the BMAD → PocketFlow generator is correctly implemented in the test stage.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
  - **Change**: Fixed Fly.io deployment step syntax error (line 105-114)
  - **Why**: The original implementation incorrectly combined `uses` and `run` in a single step, which is invalid GitHub Actions syntax
  - **How**: Split into two separate steps - one for setting up flyctl and another for executing the deployment command

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows KISS principles, clean YAML structure
- Project Structure: ✓ Correct file locations as per architecture docs
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test stage with unit and integration tests
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed GitHub Actions syntax error for Fly.io deployment
- [x] Verified proper sequencing of CI/CD stages
- [x] Confirmed BMAD → PocketFlow generator integration
- [x] Validated rollback strategies and documentation
- [ ] Consider adding deployment smoke tests beyond health check
- [ ] Add notification steps for deployment failures
- [ ] Consider implementing staging environment deployment before production

### Security Review

No security concerns found. Implementation correctly:
- Uses GitHub secrets for sensitive data
- Avoids hardcoding credentials
- Uses minimal required permissions for each job
- Implements proper authentication for container registry

### Performance Considerations

Strong performance optimizations implemented:
- Docker layer caching via GitHub Actions cache
- Efficient use of build cache strategies
- Parallel job execution where appropriate
- Minimal image size through proper Docker build practices

### KISS Principles Validation

Excellent adherence to KISS principles throughout:
- Simple three-stage pipeline without unnecessary complexity
- Clear separation of concerns between stages
- Straightforward rollback mechanisms
- No over-engineering or premature optimization
- Clean, readable YAML without excessive nesting

### BMAD → PocketFlow Integration

The integration is properly implemented:
- Generator runs in test stage before deployment
- Correct command: `python scripts/bmad2pf.py --src ./bmad --out ./generated`
- Generated code is included in Docker build
- Maintains the core requirement of sub-second generation time

### Final Status

✓ **Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation successfully meets all acceptance criteria with strong adherence to KISS principles and proper BMAD/PocketFlow integration. The minor syntax fix for Fly.io deployment has been applied. The optional improvements listed above can be considered for future enhancements but are not blocking for completion.
