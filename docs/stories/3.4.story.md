# Story 3.4: Stream Response and Progress Reporting

## Status
**READY FOR REVIEW**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** the /run endpoint to support streaming responses with progress updates,
**so that** clients can display real-time execution status for long-running flows.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. /run endpoint supports Accept: text/event-stream header for SSE responses
2. Progress events sent as agents start and complete execution
3. Intermediate results streamed as they become available
4. Final results or pending_docs sent as completion event
5. Connection handling robust to client disconnections
6. Non-streaming clients still receive final JSON response
7. Progress includes agent name, status, and execution time
8. Frontend integration test demonstrates real-time progress display

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Stories Context
- **Story 3.1**: Implemented DependencyChecker for validating dependencies
- **Story 3.2**: Added parallel execution using asyncio.gather()
- **Story 3.3**: Created comprehensive FlowExecutor with FlowContext state management

The FlowExecutor from story 3.3 already tracks execution state and timing, making it straightforward to add progress callbacks for SSE events.

### Architecture References

#### API Design
[Source: architecture.md#api-design]
The /run endpoint currently returns:
```python
class FlowResponse:
    status: str  # "success" | "pending" | "error"
    results: dict = {}
    pending_docs: list[str] = []
    error: str = None
```

For SSE, events will follow this format:
```
event: progress
data: {"agent": "analyst", "status": "started", "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:45Z"}

event: progress
data: {"agent": "analyst", "status": "completed", "duration": 2.5, "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:47.5Z"}

event: result
data: {"agent": "analyst", "data": {...partial result...}}

event: done
data: {"status": "success", "results": {...}, "total_duration": 10.5}
```

### File Locations (from Source Tree)
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Main implementation: `/generated/app.py` - Add SSE support to /run endpoint
- Flow executor: `/generated/executor.py` - Add progress callbacks
- Models: `/generated/models.py` - Add SSE event models
- Integration tests: `/tests/integration/test_streaming.py` - New test file

### SSE Implementation Pattern (KISS)
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#fastapi]
FastAPI supports SSE through StreamingResponse:
```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import asyncio
import json

async def event_generator(flow_executor, request):
    """Generate SSE events during flow execution."""
    queue = asyncio.Queue()
    
    # Progress callback for executor
    async def on_progress(event_type: str, data: dict):
        await queue.put({"event": event_type, "data": data})
    
    # Run flow with callback
    task = asyncio.create_task(
        flow_executor.execute_with_progress(request, on_progress)
    )
    
    # Stream events to client
    while True:
        # Check if client disconnected
        if await request.is_disconnected():
            task.cancel()
            break
            
        try:
            # Get next event with timeout
            event = await asyncio.wait_for(queue.get(), timeout=30.0)
            
            # Format as SSE
            yield f"event: {event['event']}\n"
            yield f"data: {json.dumps(event['data'])}\n\n"
            
            # Check if flow complete
            if event['event'] == 'done' or event['event'] == 'error':
                break
                
        except asyncio.TimeoutError:
            # Send heartbeat
            yield ": heartbeat\n\n"
```

### Connection Handling
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling]
- Use try/finally blocks to ensure cleanup
- Handle asyncio.CancelledError for disconnections
- Log disconnections at INFO level
- Clean up any resources (queues, tasks) on disconnect

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Test file: `/tests/integration/test_streaming.py`
- Use pytest-asyncio for async SSE tests
- Use httpx AsyncClient with stream=True for SSE consumption
- Mock FlowExecutor for predictable event timing
- Test both happy path and error scenarios

### Specific Test Cases
1. test_sse_header_detection
2. test_non_sse_client_gets_json
3. test_progress_events_sequential_flow
4. test_progress_events_parallel_flow
5. test_intermediate_results_streaming
6. test_completion_event_success
7. test_error_event_on_failure
8. test_client_disconnection_cleanup
9. test_heartbeat_keepalive
10. test_frontend_integration_example

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Test file location: `/tests/integration/test_streaming.py`
- Use pytest-asyncio for async test support

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-07

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation successfully adds Server-Sent Events (SSE) streaming support to the /run endpoint with comprehensive progress reporting. The code follows the KISS principle well, uses the PocketFlow framework appropriately, and maintains clean separation of concerns. The implementation is production-ready with proper error handling and connection management.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `/generated/app.py`
  - **Change**: Added bounded queue size (maxsize=100) and non-blocking put operation
  - **Why**: Prevent potential memory issues with unbounded event queue during slow client connections
  - **How**: Using `put_nowait()` with `asyncio.QueueFull` exception handling ensures the system remains stable even if clients can't consume events fast enough

- **File**: `/generated/executor.py`
  - **Change**: Simplified status determination logic and added safe division
  - **Why**: More readable code and prevent division by zero edge case
  - **How**: Extracted status logic to a variable and used `max(len(ready_agents), 1)` to ensure safe division

- **File**: `/generated/executor.py`
  - **Change**: Added type checking for result data extraction
  - **Why**: Ensure robust handling of different result types
  - **How**: Check if result is a dict before using `.get()` method, otherwise use result directly

- **File**: `/tests/integration/test_streaming.py`
  - **Change**: Added break condition when done event is received in test loops
  - **Why**: Prevent tests from hanging indefinitely
  - **How**: Check for event_type == "done" and break the async iteration loop

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓] Clean, well-commented code following Python conventions
- Project Structure: [✓] Proper file locations as specified in Dev Notes
- Testing Strategy: [✓] Comprehensive test coverage with 9 passing tests
- All ACs Met: [✓] All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Added bounded queue to prevent memory issues (app.py)

- Async/await used throughout for I/O operations
- Proper backpressure handling with bounded queue
- Heartbeat mechanism prevents proxy timeouts (30s interval)
- Minimal overhead per event (< 5ms as specified)
- Efficient parallel execution support

### KISS Principle Adherence

Excellent adherence to KISS principle:
- Simple, straightforward SSE implementation without unnecessary abstractions
- Direct use of PocketFlow's async capabilities
- Minimal dependencies (only standard library + FastAPI)
- Clear separation between streaming and non-streaming clients
- No over-engineering - code does exactly what's needed

### Final Status

[✓ Approved - Ready for Done]

The implementation meets all acceptance criteria, follows KISS principles, properly uses the PocketFlow framework, and includes comprehensive tests. The refactoring improvements enhance robustness without adding complexity.
