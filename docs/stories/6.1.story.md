# Story 6.1: Status-Only Orchestration API

## Status
**DONE**

## Story
**As an** external workflow engine,
**I want** a minimal REST API that only tracks agent execution status,
**so that** I can make all workflow decisions while getting clear visibility into execution states.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **GET /orchestration/status**: Returns workflow status with agent states in JSON format
2. **PUT /orchestration/status**: Allows external systems to update agent execution status
3. **No Business Logic**: Orchestrator contains zero logic for flow control, retries, or error handling
4. **File-Based Storage**: Status persisted in JSONL format following KISS principle
5. **Multi-Workflow Support**: Can track multiple concurrent workflows without interference
6. **Real-Time Updates**: Status changes immediately visible via API
7. **Simple Data Model**: Status format: `{workflow_id, story_id, agent_statuses: {agent_id: {status, last_execution}}}`
8. **OpenAPI Documentation**: Complete API specification for external system integration

## Dev Notes

### Previous Stories Context
- **Story 5.3**: Already implemented basic orchestrator status tracking with GET/PUT /orchestration/status/{workflow_id}
- **Story 5.4**: Implemented stateless agent execution with structured outputs
- This story (6.1) refines and extends the orchestrator from 5.3 with story_id support and improved API

### Architecture References

#### Enhanced Data Model
[Source: PRD Epic 6 - Story 6.1]
Update the existing WorkflowStatus model to include story_id:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Dict, Optional
from datetime import datetime

class AgentStatus(BaseModel):
    status: Literal["pending", "running", "completed", "failed", "needs_input"]
    last_execution: Optional[datetime] = None
    output_summary: Optional[str] = None

class WorkflowStatus(BaseModel):
    workflow_id: str = Field(..., pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$")
    story_id: str = Field(..., pattern="^[a-zA-Z0-9-_.]+$")  # New field
    agent_statuses: Dict[str, AgentStatus] = {}
    created_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
    updated_at: datetime = Field(default_factory=datetime.utcnow)
```

#### Query-Based Status Retrieval
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#FastAPI]
Implement flexible querying:
```python
@app.get("/orchestration/status")
async def get_status(
    workflow_id: Optional[str] = None,
    story_id: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: int = Query(100, le=1000)
) -> List[WorkflowStatus]:
    """Get status with optional filters."""
    statuses = await orchestrator.get_statuses(
        workflow_id=workflow_id,
        story_id=story_id,
        limit=limit
    )
    return statuses
```

#### JSONL Storage Pattern
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Runtime Directories]
Continue using JSONL but with enhanced indexing:
```
memory/
├── shared/
│   ├── orchestrator_{workflow_id}.jsonl  # Existing
│   └── orchestrator_index.jsonl          # New: Index by story_id
```

#### KISS Implementation Strategy
Following KISS principle:
1. **Minimal changes**: Build on existing Story 5.3 implementation
2. **No new complexity**: Just add story_id field
3. **Simple queries**: Basic filtering, no complex search
4. **Pure storage**: Zero business logic
5. **Clear separation**: External systems make all decisions

#### Migration from Story 5.3
Since Story 5.3 already implemented most functionality:
1. Reuse existing StatusService class
2. Add story_id to the data model
3. Update endpoints to new paths
4. Keep existing /orchestration/status/{workflow_id} for compatibility
5. Add new query-based endpoints

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Models update: `/generated/models.py` (extend WorkflowStatus)
- Service update: `/generated/orchestrator_status.py` (add query methods)
- Endpoints: `/generated/app.py` (add new endpoints)
- Tests: `/tests/integration/test_orchestration_api.py` (new)

### Implementation Notes
- **CRITICAL**: This is purely a storage API - NO workflow logic
- Build upon Story 5.3's implementation, don't replace it
- Story_id format should support semantic versioning (e.g., "5.1", "5.2")
- Consider adding a simple in-memory cache for frequently accessed statuses
- Retention policy should be configurable but default to 7 days
- All decisions about retry, parallelism, error handling belong to external systems

### API Examples

#### GET /orchestration/status
```json
// Request: GET /orchestration/status?story_id=5.1
// Response:
[
  {
    "workflow_id": "workflow-123",
    "story_id": "5.1",
    "agent_statuses": {
      "parser": {"status": "completed", "last_execution": "2025-01-08T10:00:00Z"},
      "generator": {"status": "running", "last_execution": "2025-01-08T10:01:00Z"}
    },
    "created_at": "2025-01-08T09:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-08T10:01:00Z"
  }
]
```

#### PUT /orchestration/status
```json
// Request: PUT /orchestration/status
{
  "workflow_id": "workflow-456",
  "story_id": "5.2",
  "agent_statuses": {
    "validator": {"status": "pending"}
  }
}
// Response: 200 OK with updated status
```
