# Story 3.3: Comprehensive Flow Orchestration Logic

## Status
DONE

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** complete flow orchestration that handles sequential, parallel, and dependent agent execution,
**so that** complex BMAD workflows execute correctly according to their defined patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Flow orchestrator builds execution plan from agent metadata and workflow configuration
2. Sequential agents execute in defined order with results passing between them
3. Parallel groups identified and executed concurrently at appropriate points
4. Dependencies checked before each agent/group execution
5. Flow context maintains state across entire execution (completed agents, results, errors)
6. Graceful handling of partial failures with clear error reporting
7. GET /agent/{name}/ready endpoint reports last successful execution timestamp
8. Integration tests verify complex flows with mixed sequential/parallel execution

## Tasks / Subtasks

## Dev Notes

### Previous Stories Context
- **Story 3.1**: Implemented DependencyChecker for validating document and agent dependencies
- **Story 3.2**: Added parallel execution using asyncio.gather() with memory isolation

This story combines these components into a complete flow orchestrator that handles all execution patterns.

### Architecture References
[Source: architecture.md#flow-executor]
Flow Executor in `generated/executor.py` should include classes: `FlowContext`, `AgentExecutor`, `ParallelGroup` with retry logic, fallback handling, and partial failure recovery.

### File Locations (from Source Tree)
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- Main implementation: `/generated/executor.py` - Flow execution engine
- API endpoint: `/generated/app.py` - Add /agent/{name}/ready endpoint
- Workflow config: `/bmad/workflow.yaml` - Optional workflow definition
- Integration tests: `/tests/integration/test_flow.py` - Flow execution tests

### Data Models
[Source: architecture.md#data-models]
```python
class FlowRequest:
    flow: str = "default"
    input: str
    story_id: str

class FlowResponse:
    status: str  # "success" | "pending" | "error"
    results: dict = {}
    pending_docs: list[str] = []
    error: str = None
```

### PocketFlow Integration
[Source: pocketflow_docs/core_abstraction/flow.md]
PocketFlow Flow class orchestrates node graphs with action-based transitions. Our orchestrator wraps PocketFlow nodes, adding dependency checking and parallel execution at the generator level without modifying PocketFlow itself.

### KISS Principle Implementation
- **Simple execution plan**: List of groups, each group is either sequential or parallel
- **Reuse existing components**: DependencyChecker + parallel execution from previous stories
- **Simple state management**: Just a dict tracking completed agents and results
- **No complex scheduling**: Execute groups in order, that's it
- **Clear error handling**: Collect errors, continue when possible, report at end

### Execution Plan Structure (KISS)
```python
# Simple execution plan structure
execution_plan = [
    {"type": "sequential", "agents": ["analyst"]},
    {"type": "parallel", "agents": ["validator", "formatter"]},
    {"type": "sequential", "agents": ["reviewer"]},
]

# Simple flow context
class FlowContext:
    def __init__(self, story_id: str):
        self.story_id = story_id
        self.completed_agents = []
        self.results = {}
        self.errors = []
        self.last_execution = {}  # agent_name -> timestamp
```

### Workflow Configuration (Optional)
[Source: bmad/workflow.yaml example]
```yaml
flows:
  default:
    sequence:
      - analyst  # Sequential
      - [validator, formatter]  # Parallel group
      - reviewer  # Sequential
```

If no workflow.yaml exists, build execution plan from agent metadata order.

### Error Handling Strategy
- Non-critical errors: Log and continue, add to errors list
- Critical errors (missing required dependencies): Return pending_docs
- All errors reported in final response with context

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Test file: `/tests/integration/test_flow.py`
- Use pytest-asyncio for async tests
- Mock agents for predictable behavior
- Test complex scenarios with mixed execution patterns
