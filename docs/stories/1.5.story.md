# Story 1.5: CLI Tool with Progress Feedback

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a command-line tool that orchestrates the complete generation pipeline,
**so that** I can convert BMAD artifacts to PocketFlow code with a single command.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. CLI script (bmad2pf.py) accepts --src and --out parameters for input/output directories
2. Progress messages displayed for each pipeline stage with timing information
3. Total generation time displayed upon completion (must be under 1 second)
4. Clear error messages with file locations for any parsing or generation failures
5. --verbose flag provides detailed debug output when needed
6. --help displays usage information and available options
7. Exit codes properly set (0 for success, non-zero for errors)
8. Integration test verifies end-to-end generation from sample BMAD files

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Task 1: Create main CLI script with argument parsing (AC: 1, 6)
  - [x] Create scripts/bmad2pf.py as main entry point
  - [x] Implement argparse for command-line arguments (--src, --out, --verbose, --help)
  - [x] Add validation for source and output directory paths

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Context
From Story 1.4 completion notes:
- Generator class successfully implemented with Jinja2 templates
- Generation time measured at <500ms for typical projects (well within 1 second requirement)
- Black and ruff formatting integrated and working
- Generated code structure validated with AST parsing

### CLI Implementation (KISS Approach)
[Source: CLAUDE.md - KISS principle, PocketFlow cookbook examples]

Keep the CLI simple and focused:
```python
# Simple entry point following cookbook patterns
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import sys
    sys.exit(main())
```

### File Structure

```

### Command-Line Interface Design
[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#development-tools]

Using Python's built-in argparse for zero additional dependencies:
```python
import argparse
import time
from pathlib import Path

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(
        prog="bmad2pf",
        description="Convert BMAD artifacts to PocketFlow code"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--src", 
        default="./bmad",
        help="Source directory containing BMAD files"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--out",
        default="./generated", 
        help="Output directory for generated code"
    )
    parser.add_argument(
        "--verbose", "-v",
        action="store_true",
        help="Enable verbose output"
    )
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    
    # Pipeline execution with timing
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    # ... execute pipeline stages ...
    elapsed = time.perf_counter() - start_time
    print(f"✓ Generation complete in {elapsed:.3f}s")
```

### Progress Messages Format
Following KISS principle - simple, clear progress indicators:
```
→ Parsing BMAD files from ./bmad...
  ✓ Found 4 agents
→ Loading configuration...
  ✓ Loaded workflow.yaml
→ Generating PocketFlow code...
  ✓ Generated 4 agent modules
  ✓ Generated FastAPI application
→ Formatting code...
  ✓ Black formatting applied
  ✓ Ruff validation passed
✓ Generation complete in 0.487s
```

### Error Handling Strategy
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#error-handling]

Clear, actionable error messages:
```python
try:
    agents = parse_bmad_files(src_dir)
except ParsingError as e:
    print(f"✗ Error parsing BMAD file: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    return 2  # Exit code for parsing error
except Exception as e:
    print(f"✗ Unexpected error: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
    return 1  # General error exit code
```

### Exit Codes Convention
- 0: Success
- 1: General/unexpected error
- 2: Parsing error (BMAD files)
- 3: Generation error (templates)
- 4: Validation error (config/workflow)
- 5: I/O error (file permissions, missing directories)

### Performance Requirements
[Source: PRD - FR15, Story 1.5 AC #3]
- Total generation must complete in under 1 second
- Previous components already optimized:
  - Parser: ~100ms for typical project
  - Generator: <500ms confirmed in Story 1.4
  - Formatting: ~200ms for black+ruff
- Total budget: ~800ms typical, well under 1 second requirement

### Dependencies
[Source: Story 1.1 - already installed]
All dependencies from previous stories are already available:
- No new dependencies needed for CLI
- Using Python standard library's argparse, time, sys, pathlib

### Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Integration test in `tests/integration/test_cli.py`
- Use subprocess to test actual CLI invocation
- Verify exit codes, output messages, and generated files
- Performance assertion for < 1 second generation

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: Excellent implementation with comprehensive features, robust error handling, and well-structured test coverage. The CLI tool successfully orchestrates the generation pipeline with clear progress feedback and timing information. Performance requirement (<1s) is consistently met with typical execution at ~0.6s. Code follows KISS principle and maintains high readability.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required. The implementation is clean, well-structured, and follows best practices:
- Clear separation of concerns with dedicated functions for validation, progress reporting, and error handling
- Proper use of pathlib for cross-platform compatibility
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate exit codes
- Well-documented code with clear docstrings

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ Follows PEP 8 (with acceptable E402 exceptions for sys.path modification)
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Proper placement in scripts/ directory as specified
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ Comprehensive integration tests with 8 test cases
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

All implementation requirements have been met. Minor technical debt noted but acceptable:

- [x] Verbose mode with debug output (AC 5)
- [x] Comprehensive integration testing (AC 8)
- [ ] E402 linting exceptions for sys.path modification (acceptable pattern for standalone scripts)

### Security Review

✓ No security concerns identified:
- No hardcoded credentials or sensitive data
- Proper input validation for file paths
- Safe use of subprocess in tests with controlled inputs
- No arbitrary code execution vulnerabilities

### Performance Considerations

✓ **Excellent Performance**: 
- Generation consistently completes in ~0.6s (requirement: <1.0s)
- Efficient pipeline orchestration with minimal overhead
- Performance tests verify consistency across multiple runs
- Subprocess overhead in tests properly accounted for (<2s total)

### Test Coverage Analysis

✓ **Comprehensive Test Coverage**:
- Help command functionality
- Missing source directory handling
- Successful generation pipeline
- Verbose mode output
- Generated code syntax validation
- Exit code verification
- Performance requirements
- Real BMAD file compatibility

### Final Status

**✓ Approved - Ready for Done**

The implementation exceeds requirements with robust error handling, comprehensive testing, and excellent performance. The minor E402 linting warnings are acceptable for a standalone CLI script that needs to modify sys.path for imports. The code is production-ready and maintains high quality standards throughout.
