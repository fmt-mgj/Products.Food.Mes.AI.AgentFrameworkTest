# Story 5.3: Ultra-Simple Orchestrator Status Tracking

## Status
**DONE**

## Story
**As an** external workflow system,
**I want** a minimal orchestrator that only tracks agent execution status without embedded business logic,
**so that** I can control workflow execution decisions while getting clear visibility into agent states.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Status-Only API**: Orchestrator provides GET/PUT endpoints for status tracking without any execution decision logic
2. **External System Control**: All workflow decisions (retry, parallel execution, error handling) made by external systems
3. **Structured Status Objects**: Status tracking uses clear JSON format: `{workflow_id, agent_statuses: {agent_id: {status, last_execution, output_summary}}}`
4. **Real-time Updates**: Status updates available immediately after agent execution via REST API
5. **No Embedded Logic**: Orchestrator contains zero business logic for flow control, dependencies, or error recovery
6. **Multiple Workflow Support**: Can track status for multiple concurrent workflows without interference
7. **Simple Persistence**: Status stored in file-based format (JSONL) following KISS principle
8. **Clear API Documentation**: OpenAPI specification for external system integration

## Dev Notes

### Previous Stories Context
Story 5.2 successfully implemented cookbook pattern mappings and validation tools. The pattern mapping includes:
- Stateless execution using `pocketflow-structured-output/` patterns
- External control via `pocketflow-communication/` shared store patterns
- KISS principle adherence throughout implementation
- Performance optimization achieving <0.01s generation time

### Architecture References

#### FastAPI Endpoint Implementation
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Application Framework]
Use standard FastAPI patterns with async endpoints:
```python
@app.get("/orchestration/status/{workflow_id}")
async def get_status(workflow_id: str) -> WorkflowStatus:
    # Implementation here
```

#### Pydantic Model Definition
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Request/Response Validation]
Define clear data models:
```python
class AgentStatus(BaseModel):
    status: Literal["pending", "running", "completed", "failed", "needs_input"]
    last_execution: Optional[datetime] = None
    output_summary: Optional[str] = None

class WorkflowStatus(BaseModel):
    workflow_id: str
    agent_statuses: Dict[str, AgentStatus]
```

#### File Storage Location
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Runtime Directories]
- Storage path: `/memory/shared/orchestrator_{workflow_id}.jsonl`
- Format: JSONL with one status object per line
- Access: Async file operations using aiofiles

#### KISS Implementation Strategy
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#General Principles]
Following KISS principle:
1. **No Complex Logic**: Status tracking only, no orchestration decisions
2. **Simple File Storage**: JSONL files in /memory/shared/ directory
3. **Clear API**: Two main endpoints (GET/PUT) with obvious behavior
4. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only FastAPI, Pydantic, aiofiles needed

#### Async File Operations
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#File Operations]
```python
import aiofiles
import json

async def read_status(workflow_id: str) -> Optional[WorkflowStatus]:
    file_path = f"memory/shared/orchestrator_{workflow_id}.jsonl"
    if not os.path.exists(file_path):
        return None
    
    async with aiofiles.open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        lines = await f.readlines()
        if lines:
            # Get last status from JSONL
            last_line = lines[-1]
            data = json.loads(last_line)
            return WorkflowStatus(**data)
    return None
```

#### Security Validation
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#Input Validation]
Validate workflow_id to prevent path traversal:
```python
@validator("workflow_id")
def validate_workflow_id(cls, v):
    if ".." in v or "/" in v or "\\" in v:
        raise ValueError("Invalid workflow ID")
    if not re.match(r"^[a-zA-Z0-9-_]+$", v):
        raise ValueError("Workflow ID must be alphanumeric with - or _")
    return v
```

### File Locations
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]
- New endpoint code: `/generated/app.py` (add to existing FastAPI app)
- Status models: `/generated/models.py` (create new file)
- Status storage: `/memory/shared/orchestrator_{workflow_id}.jsonl`
- Tests: `/tests/integration/test_orchestrator_status.py` (new)

### Implementation Notes
- **CRITICAL**: This orchestrator has ZERO business logic - it's purely a status tracker
- External systems make ALL decisions about retries, parallelism, error handling
- Status updates are immediate - no queuing or delayed processing
- Each status update appends to JSONL for audit trail, but API returns only latest
- No authentication required in MVP (can add later via middleware)

## Testing

### Testing Standards

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of an ultra-simple orchestrator that strictly adheres to the KISS principle. The solution provides pure status tracking with absolutely zero business logic, exactly as specified. The implementation is clean, well-documented, and follows all architectural guidelines from the Dev Notes.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: generated/orchestrator_status.py
  - **Change**: Fixed line length issue by moving comment to separate line
  - **Why**: Compliance with ruff linting standards (88 character limit)
  - **How**: Improves code readability and maintains consistent formatting

- **File**: generated/orchestrator_status.py
  - **Change**: Fixed JSON serialization issue in write_status method
  - **Why**: model_dump() returns datetime objects which are not JSON serializable
  - **How**: Changed to use model_dump_json() which properly serializes datetime to ISO format strings

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: âœ“ Code follows PEP 8, uses proper type hints, clear naming
- Project Structure: âœ“ Files correctly placed per architecture guidance
- Testing Strategy: âœ“ Comprehensive unit and integration tests with good coverage
- All ACs Met: âœ“ All 8 acceptance criteria fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

[x] Fixed ruff linting issue with line length
[x] Fixed JSON serialization for datetime objects
[x] Verified all tests pass after refactoring
[x] Confirmed zero business logic in orchestrator
[x] Validated JSONL append mode preserves history

### Security Review

- Path traversal protection properly implemented via workflow ID validation
- Regex validation prevents special characters in workflow IDs
- No security vulnerabilities identified

### Performance Considerations

- Async file operations used throughout for non-blocking I/O
- JSONL format allows efficient append operations
- Simple file-based storage follows KISS principle
- No performance issues identified

### Final Status

âœ“ Approved - Ready for Done

The implementation perfectly achieves the goal of an ultra-simple status-only orchestrator. It contains absolutely zero workflow logic, making all endpoints pure CRUD operations for status tracking. The KISS principle is exemplified throughout with simple file storage, minimal dependencies, and clear separation of concerns. External systems have complete control over all workflow decisions while getting real-time visibility into agent states.
