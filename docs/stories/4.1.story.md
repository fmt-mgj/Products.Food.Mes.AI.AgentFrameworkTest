# Story 4.1: Docker Containerization with Multi-stage Build

## Status
**Done**

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a Dockerfile that packages the entire application efficiently,
**so that** the system can be deployed consistently across different environments.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Multi-stage Dockerfile created with builder stage for generation and runtime stage for execution
2. Only necessary files copied to final image (no source BMAD files or test files)
3. Python dependencies installed via pip with pinned versions for reproducibility
4. Container starts with single CMD running uvicorn with proper production settings
5. Environment variables documented for runtime configuration
6. Health check configured in Dockerfile for container orchestration
7. Final image size under 200MB with Alpine Linux base
8. Docker build completes in under 60 seconds with layer caching

## Dev Notes

### Previous Stories Context
Epic 4 is the first deployment-focused epic. Previous epics (1-3) established:
- **Epic 1**: Generator and CLI tool (bmad2pf.py)
- **Epic 2**: FastAPI runtime with core endpoints
- **Epic 3**: Flow orchestration and streaming

This story packages everything into a deployable container.

### KISS Multi-Stage Dockerfile Structure
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder - Generate PocketFlow code from BMAD
FROM python:3.10-alpine AS builder
WORKDIR /build

# Install generation dependencies
COPY requirements-gen.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements-gen.txt

# Copy BMAD sources and generator
COPY bmad/ ./bmad/
COPY scripts/ ./scripts/
COPY config/ ./config/

# Generate code
RUN python scripts/bmad2pf.py --src ./bmad --out ./generated

# Stage 2: Runtime - Minimal production image
FROM python:3.10-alpine AS runtime
WORKDIR /app

# Install runtime dependencies only
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN apk add --no-cache --virtual .build-deps gcc musl-dev \
    && pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt \
    && apk del .build-deps

# Copy only generated code and config
COPY --from=builder /build/generated ./generated
COPY --from=builder /build/config ./config
COPY docs/ ./docs/

# Runtime configuration
ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
    PORT=8000 \
    WORKERS=1 \
    LOG_LEVEL=info

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
    CMD python -c "import requests; requests.get('http://localhost:8000/health')"

# Start server
CMD uvicorn generated.app:app \
    --host 0.0.0.0 \
    --port $PORT \
    --workers $WORKERS \
    --log-level $LOG_LEVEL
```

### Environment Variables
[Source: architecture.md#configuration-management]
```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...        # LLM provider API key

# Optional with defaults
PORT=8000                     # Server port
WORKERS=1                     # Uvicorn workers
LOG_LEVEL=info               # Logging level
MEMORY_BACKEND=file          # Memory storage (file|redis)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost  # If using Redis backend
MAX_AGENTS=10                # Max parallel agents
TIMEOUT=300                  # Agent execution timeout
```

### Docker Optimization Tips (KISS)
1. **Layer Caching**: Put least-changing items first (dependencies before code)
2. **Multi-stage**: Keep build tools out of runtime image
3. **Alpine Linux**: Smallest base image, but watch for compatibility
4. **.dockerignore**: Essential for build speed and image size
5. **No Cache Pip**: Use `--no-cache-dir` to reduce image size
6. **Virtual Packages**: Use Alpine's `--virtual` for easy cleanup

### .dockerignore Content

# Development files

```

### Build Performance Targets
- **Without cache**: < 60 seconds (AC 8)
- **With cache**: < 10 seconds (only changed layers rebuild)
- **Final image size**: < 200MB (AC 7)
- **Startup time**: < 5 seconds to ready state

## Testing

### Testing Standards
[Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#testing-standards]
- Test build process with: `docker build -t bmad-pocketflow .`
- Test runtime with: `docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env bmad-pocketflow`
- Verify health check: `docker inspect --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}' <container>`
- Check image size: `docker images bmad-pocketflow --format "table {{.Repository}}\t{{.Tag}}\t{{.Size}}"`
