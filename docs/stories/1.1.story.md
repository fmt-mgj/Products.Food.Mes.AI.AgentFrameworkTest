# Story 1.1: Project Foundation and Development Environment

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a properly structured Python project with all necessary dependencies and development tools configured,
**so that** I can begin implementing the BMAD to PocketFlow generator with a consistent development environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Python project structure created with /bmad, /generated, /scripts, /config, /docs, /tests directories
2. Project initialized with pyproject.toml or setup.py including all required dependencies (pocketflow, fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, jinja2, pyyaml, black, ruff)
3. Development environment configuration documented in README with setup instructions
4. Pre-commit hooks configured for black and ruff code formatting
5. Basic pytest configuration established with example test file
6. .gitignore properly configured to exclude /generated directory and environment files
7. Virtual environment setup automated via requirements.txt or Pipfile

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Information
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md]

The project structure must follow this exact layout:
```
bmad-pocketflow/
├── bmad/                  # User-edited BMAD source files
├── config/                # Runtime configuration (preserved)
├── docs/                  # Documentation
├── generated/             # Generated code (never edit manually)
├── scripts/               # Generator and utility scripts
└── tests/                 # Test suite
    ├── unit/             # Unit tests
    └── integration/      # Integration tests
```

### Required Dependencies from Tech Stack
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Production Dependencies (requirements.txt):**

- python-dotenv>=1.0.0

**Development Dependencies (requirements-dev.txt):**
- pytest>=7.4.0
- pytest-asyncio
- pytest-cov
- pytest-mock
- black>=23.12.0
- ruff>=0.1.8
- pre-commit>=3.5.0
- coverage>=7.3.0

### Code Quality Configuration
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

**Black Configuration (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
[tool.black]
line-length = 88
target-version = ['py310']
```

**Ruff Configuration (pyproject.toml):**
```toml
[tool.ruff]
line-length = 88
select = ["E", "F", "I", "N", "W"]
```

**Pytest Configuration (pyproject.toml or pytest.ini):**
```ini
[tool.pytest.ini_options]
asyncio_mode = "auto"
testpaths = ["tests"]
```

### Testing
[Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

- Test files should be placed in `tests/unit/` for unit tests and `tests/integration/` for integration tests
- Use pytest as the testing framework with pytest-asyncio for async test support
- Aim for minimum 80% code coverage for core modules
- Tests should follow the pattern `test_*.py` for automatic discovery

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-06

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment**: The project foundation implementation is comprehensive and well-structured, demonstrating good understanding of Python project best practices. The directory structure, configuration files, and testing framework are properly implemented according to the story requirements.

**Strengths Observed:**
- Excellent directory structure following the specified architecture
- Comprehensive configuration files with appropriate settings
- Good test examples demonstrating various pytest patterns
- Proper .gitignore configuration excluding generated files
- Well-documented setup instructions in README

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring was required as the configuration files are well-structured and follow best practices.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **PASSED** - Black and Ruff properly configured in pyproject.toml
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **PASSED** - All required directories created matching source-tree.md specification
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **PASSED** - Pytest configuration with async support, proper testpaths, and comprehensive example tests
- **All ACs Met**: ✓ **PASSED** - All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Development Environment:**
- ✗ **Issue Found**: Development dependencies (black, ruff, pre-commit) appear not to be installed in current environment
- ✗ **Issue Found**: Pre-commit hooks not installed/working in current environment
- [x] All configuration files properly created and structured
- [x] Requirements files contain correct dependencies with proper version pinning
- [x] Testing framework configured correctly
- [x] Documentation complete with setup instructions

**Recommendations for Developer:**
- [ ] Ensure `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt` is run to install development tools
- [ ] Run `pre-commit install` to activate pre-commit hooks
- [ ] Verify all tools work with `black --check .` and `ruff check .`

### Security Review

**Assessment**: ✓ **SECURE**
- Proper .gitignore patterns prevent committing sensitive files (.env, *.key, *.pem)
- Generated code directory excluded from version control
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials detected

### Performance Considerations

**Assessment**: ✓ **GOOD**
- Pytest configured with appropriate markers for test categorization
- Async test support properly configured
- Project structure optimized for development workflow

### Dependencies Review

**Production Dependencies (requirements.txt):**
- ✓ All required dependencies present with proper version constraints
- ✓ PocketFlow core framework included (pocketflow==0.0.3)
- ✓ FastAPI stack properly configured
- ✓ No unnecessary dependencies

**Development Dependencies (requirements-dev.txt):**
- ✓ Testing framework complete with coverage and async support
- ✓ Code quality tools (black, ruff) with appropriate versions
- ✓ Pre-commit framework included

### Configuration Quality Review

**pyproject.toml**: ✓ **EXCELLENT**
- Black configuration matches dev notes specification (line-length=88, py310)
- Ruff configuration properly set with required rules (E, F, I, N, W)
- Pytest configuration with async mode and proper test discovery

**pytest.ini**: ✓ **COMPREHENSIVE**
- Proper async mode configuration
- Good test discovery patterns
- Useful markers defined for test categorization
- Verbose output and strict markers configured

### Final Status

✓ **APPROVED - Ready for Done**

**Summary**: This is a high-quality project foundation implementation that demonstrates senior-level attention to detail. All acceptance criteria are met, configuration files are properly structured, and the setup follows established best practices. The only issues are environmental (tools need to be installed), not implementation flaws.

**Next Steps for Story Completion:**
1. Developer should ensure development environment is properly set up
2. Story can be marked as "Done" - implementation is complete and correct
